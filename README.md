F**k keyboard only support in rpg maker games.

Now you can create Profiles to play different games with different configuration ;)

In order to run this "app" you need to do `pip install pygame pynput colorama psutil PyGetWindow pywin32`

To create a Profile, you must run the command `py Setup.py` and follow the instructions

To use the app, you must run the command `py Main.py`. The config the app will use is the one attached to the app that you're running.
